# **Y**et **A**nother **O**ne-**R**oom **D**ungeon  

<!-- /yuh-oord/ -->

## The Past  

Not much.  

## The Present  

### Design Philosophy and Goals  

- Difficult but not unplayable  
- Fresh but familiar <!-- Rephrase this and hope no one takes it out of context... lol -->
- Procedurally-generated mechanics (without needless repetition or stupidity)  
- Unique gameplay&mdash;and a cooperative bent  
- Ultimately, online multiplayer  
  - But not quite yet. That's a lot of work...  

## The Future: A Roadmap  

Firstly, environment.

- procgen envs; maybe z-index?
- borrow envs from familiar games such as D2
- idk this is all bull snot anyways
